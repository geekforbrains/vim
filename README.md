# Vim Setup

1. Install vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
2. Install tmux and fzf: `brew install tmux fzf`
3. Install plugins: `:PlugInstall`

## Mac OSX

1. Disable "Mission Control" arrow key bindings in System Pref > Keyboard > Shortcuts. This is so
the resize pane command works in tmux.
2. Remap "Cap Locks" to "Ctrl" in System Pref > Keyboard > Modifier Keys. This is so you can use
"Cap Locks + B" as tmux prefix.
